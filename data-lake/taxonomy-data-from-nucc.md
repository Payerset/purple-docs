# Taxonomy Data from NUCC

The National Uniform Claim Committee (NUCC) is an organization that focuses on standardizing data sets for non-institutional health care claims in the U.S. It was established in 1995, replacing the Uniform Claim Form Task Force, and plays a key role in the administrative simplification section of HIPAA. The NUCC, chaired by the American Medical Association, collaborates with a diverse group of health care stakeholders, including providers, payers, and vendors.&#x20;
