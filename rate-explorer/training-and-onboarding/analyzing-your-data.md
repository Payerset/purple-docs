# ðŸ“ˆ Analyzing your Data

## Overview

Analyzing rate comparisons and fee schedules is the core function of Payerset, providing essential insights into healthcare pricing. Our platform offers three main analysis options: the Summary Page, Data Overview, and Explore screens. Each of these options provides unique perspectives and valuable insights into healthcare pricing data from high-level summaries to granular details.

## Summary View

When your analysis is finished loading, you will land on the Summary screen, which shows you the total number of rates, providers, and services that apply to your selections and filters, as well as a distribution plot visualization of the data.

There are a few key features you can use on this screen to quickly compare rates across payers and providers.&#x20;

### Analysis Details & Metadata

You can see which payers, NPIs, and billing codes you have selected by hovering over the blue/green/purple chips at the top right of the page. If you have selected any data that does not contain rates (in the example below, you can see QualChoice does not have any data for the selected NPIs and billing codes), you will see an indicator that the data is Not Found.

### Distribution Plot

The distribution plot shows how rates are distributed by payer across providers and billing codes, which enables you to get a quick idea of how disparate rates are across those payers for the same codes.&#x20;

Rates can have different types, such as _negotiated, fee schedule, per diem,_ or _percentage_. In the chart, you can toggle between dollars and percentages. As you can see below, VIVA Health provides both dollars and percentage rates, while the other payers show dollar values only.

Hover over a point on the chart to see the payer and provider details.

### Filters

The filter options allow you to filter the data you are viewing by different dimensions so you can better compare apples-to-apples when looking at rates across codes, payers, and providers.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
You can use either the "Add Filter" dropdown or "Toggle Filter Grid" as  options for filtering. The Filter Grid option can provide a more detailed view of available filters.
{% endhint %}

To create a filter, select any combination of filters from either option.

To remove a filter, click the â“§ in the box of the filter you want to remove.

{% hint style="info" %}
You are always able to see your filters at the top of the screen so you can easily see what data you have filtered.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Filters will carry over from the Summary view to the Data and Explore views as well.
{% endhint %}

## Data View

The data view is a comprehensive table of all the data available at the rate level.

{% hint style="info" %}
The data view provides the most granular view of the data, so each record represents a single rate across all of the dimensions in the payer price transparency files.
{% endhint %}

### Sorting & Filtering

To sort the table, click on the column you want to sort by. You can also search each column using the search boxes underneath the field name.

To add more columns, click the "More columns" button on the top right of the screen and you will be able to get a broader view of the data.

{% hint style="success" %}
Export your current view by clicking the Export button.
{% endhint %}

## Explore View

The explore view is a pivot table that enables you to aggregate the data by various different dimensions, as well as view multiple different metrics.

To start, choose a column and a measure.

You can also pivot the data horizontally by Payer, NPI, Organization Name, or Billing Code to get a better view of how data compares across dimensions.&#x20;

Note that you may have to use the filters to get a good comparison of the data, and ensure that you're adding the proper columns so your comparisons are valid.
