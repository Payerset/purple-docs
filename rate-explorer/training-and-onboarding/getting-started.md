## Rate Explorer Overview

PurpleLab Rate Explorer is a tool designed to enhance health plan price transparency, offering access to comprehensive payer Machine Readable Files (MRF) data for analysis and comparison. Created to address the complexities and opacity of healthcare pricing, the portal enables users to easily navigate, understand, and benchmark healthcare pricing data across different payers and organizations. By providing clear, accessible, and actionable pricing insights, Rate Explorer supports informed decision-making in healthcare pricing and strategy.

The Payers we currently support are listed to the left under the **PAYER TRANSPARENCY** section of the documentation. Additionally, you can find information about the various fields that are available in the [Rate Explorer Data Dictionary](../data-dictionary.md).

Within a few minutes, you should receive an email from success@purplelab.com with a link to reset your password. **Be sure to check your spam mail** just in case, as sometimes companies block these types of reset emails. If you don't receive your reset email within 15 minutes, please reach out to success@purplelab.com and we will troubleshoot the issue with you.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that if your company has an email link monitoring and redirection service, these password reset links may not work. They will only work if clicked one time, and sometimes the scanning software prevents this from happening.

**If you are being redirected to the login screen** instead of the password reset screen, please contact success@purplelab.com

If you experience any issues you are unable to troubleshoot, or if you have any feedback, please email success@purplelab.com and we will get you sorted right away.
