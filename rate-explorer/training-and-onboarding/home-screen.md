# üè† Home Screen

The home screen serves as your starting point for creating new analyses and revisiting any saved analyses you've previously created. If this is your first time logging in, you will be prompted to create a new analysis.

On the home screen, you will also find information about your saved analyses, including the Payers, NPIs, and Billing Codes you selected. Hover over any tag to view the complete list of your selections.

To open an existing analysis, simply click on it. This will allow you to explore the associated data. If you're looking for a specific analysis you‚Äôve created in the past, you can also use the search function. (Tip: Remember to press Enter after typing your search terms.)
