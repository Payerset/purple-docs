# Hospital MRF - Standard Charges \[BETA]

## Standard Charges Overview (Hospital Data)

The Standard Charges rate analysis a powerful new feature of Payerset that enables users to gain comprehensive insights into the pricing structures of specific hospital systems. This tool is designed to provide a detailed view of rates for all services offered by a selected hospital, allowing for in-depth analysis and comparison.

Users can easily select a hospital system from an interactive map interface, making it simple to focus on specific geographic areas or institutions of interest.

{% hint style="danger" %}
This feature is currently in Beta. We are continuously monitoring & adding Hospital data ([found here](../../hospital-transparency/mrf-links-by-state.md)) as they are published from each individual system. Check back here often as we continue to build out new functionality and incorporate new data.

**Please note** that many of the hospitals use slightly different formats for their data and it could be missing or inaccurate, so please let us know at **support@payerset.com** if you see inaccuracies!
