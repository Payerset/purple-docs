### Additional Observations

**Machine-Readable Price Transparency Files Review**

* **MRFs Up-to-Date:** ✔️ Yes, the MRFs are kept up to date each month.
* **Table of Contents Accessibility:** ✔️ The Table of Contents link is easily accessible.
* **Table of Contents Formatting:** ✔️ Yes, the Table of Contents is properly formatted.
* **File Download Barriers:** ❌ MRF Links in the TOC expire before new links are posted, making it important to download/parse the data by the 20th of each month.
* **File Accessibility Percentage: ❌** 98% of the files are accessible.

**Overall Assessment:** BCBS Florida has a number of issues, including that their Table of Contents links expire before new links are posted (usually by the 20th of the month), and **8 of their 557** files are not accessible. Additionally, some of the data for major health systems in Florida is missing, which could be part of the inaccessible 8 files but it's more likely that these are not being reported on at all.
