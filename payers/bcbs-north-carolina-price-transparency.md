# 🟢 Blue Cross Blue Shield North Carolina

{% hint style="warning" %}
BCBS NC occasionally doesn't update their TOC link. You can derive the link using this base link and the latest update date ([https://mrfmftprod.bcbsnc.com/prod/etl/outbound/table-of-contents/non-aso/2024-01-29\_blue-cross-and-blue-shield-of-north-carolina\_index.json](https://mrfmftprod.bcbsnc.com/prod/etl/outbound/table-of-contents/non-aso/2024-01-29_blue-cross-and-blue-shield-of-north-carolina_index.json))

We will update it at the link below if it is not updated, so each quarter it will update, but if you want it more than quarterly you may have to derive it.

### Additional Observations

**Machine-Readable Price Transparency Files Review**

* **MRFs Up-to-Date:** ✔️ Yes, the MRFs are kept up to date each month.
* **Table of Contents Accessibility:** ✔️ The Table of Contents link is easily accessible.
* **Table of Contents Formatting:** ✔️ Yes, the Table of Contents is properly formatted.
* **File Download Barriers:** ✔️ No barriers to downloading the MRFs.
* **File Accessibility Percentage:** ✔️ 100% of the files are accessible.

**Overall Assessment:** Despite not updating their Table of Contents link (which we have taken care of for them above 🙂), BCBS North Carolina does a great job of posting these files each month. We aren't going to take a full star off for the TOC issue. They duplicate provider data substantially, but that can be a result of interpretation of the CMS rules.
