### Additional Observations

**Machine-Readable Price Transparency Files Review**

* **MRFs Up-to-Date:** ✔️ Yes, the MRFs are kept up to date each month, though each region appears to be updated separately and at different times.
* **Table of Contents Accessibility:** ✔️ The Table of Contents link is easily accessible.
* **Table of Contents Formatting:** ❌ Table of Contents is properly formatted for each region, but they should not be separated the way they are. This is a minor issue but does create a barrier.
* **File Download Barriers:** ❌ Molina has very (overly) strict firewall rules that block IP addresses trying to download even just a few files. This severely limits the ability to access their files and requires sophisticated programming techniques to download/stream the files from multiple IP addresses simultaneously.
* **File Accessibility Percentage:** ✔️ 100% of the files are accessible once you get past the firewall issues.

#### **Data Quality Issues**

Molina is also not compliant in their data quality, as for the negotiated\_type fields they do not follow the allowed values, instead using their own values. It's unclear what these values mean, but they can likely be mapped.&#x20;

**Overall Assessment:** Molina maintains up-to-date Machine-Readable Price Transparency Files (MRFs), but faces significant challenges in data quality compliance and file accessibility due to stringent firewall rules. Improvements in these areas are crucial for ensuring better access and understanding of the provided data.
