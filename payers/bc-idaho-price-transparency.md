### Additional Observations

**Machine-Readable Price Transparency Files Review**

* **MRFs Up-to-Date:** ✔️ Yes, the MRFs are kept up to date each month.
* **Table of Contents Accessibility:** ✔️ The Table of Contents link is easily accessible.
* **Table of Contents Formatting:** ✔️ Yes, the Table of Contents is properly formatted.
* **File Download Barriers:** ✔️ No barriers to downloading the MRFs.
* **File Accessibility Percentage:** ❌ 98% of the files are accessible.

**Overall Assessment:** Blue Cross Idaho has a number of older files that are not accessible, specifically from July 2023 and August 2022, but since they are still linked in the Table of Contents, we have to assume they are valid files, which impacts their rating . Like other blues, they duplicate provider data substantially, but that can be a result of interpretation of the CMS rules.

As of May 2024, these files are still linked but not accessible. We have determined that these files are no longer relevant, and while we hope they are removed from the Table of Contents, we are considering them fully compliant.&#x20;
