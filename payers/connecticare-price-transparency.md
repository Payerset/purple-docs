### Additional Observations

**Machine-Readable Price Transparency Files Review**

* **MRFs Up-to-Date:** ✔️ Yes, the MRFs are kept up to date each month (since April 2024).
* **Table of Contents Accessibility:** ✔️ The Table of Contents link is easily accessible - though it is very large.
* **Table of Contents Formatting:** ✔️ Yes, the Table of Contents is properly formatted.
* **File Download Barriers:** ✔️ No barriers to downloading the MRFs.
* **File Accessibility Percentage:** ✔️ 100% of the files are accessible.

**Overall Assessment:** As of April 2024, ConnectiCare is now compliant! Their table of contents file that lists all of their plans is very large, which I'm not sure is completely necessary, but still smaller than Elevance, so we won't ding them a star. Also, having over 2500 files with only 9M rate records is a bit overkill, but the download speeds are quick and the files are all accessible, so that is great. Thank you ConnectiCare!
