### Additional Observations

**Machine-Readable Price Transparency Files Review**

* **MRFs Up-to-Date:** ✔️ Yes, the MRFs are kept up to date each month, though each region appears to be updated separately and at different times.
* **Table of Contents Accessibility:** ✔️ The Table of Contents link is easily accessible.
* **Table of Contents Formatting:** ✔️ Table of Contents is properly formatted.
* **File Download Barriers:** ✔️ There are no barriers to downloading the files, though there are mostly zip files that contain thousands of other files, which makes processing a little challenging.
* **File Accessibility Percentage:** ❌ 99% of the files are accessible and uncorrupted, there are a few files that are not accessible, and there is one file that is corrupted irreparably (see below). Unfortunately, this results in a lower rating.

**Overall Assessment:** Oscar publishes their files regularly and mostly very well, though there are many thousands of files inside zip folders that are linked in the Table of Contents, which can present challenges for processing and managing the data.
