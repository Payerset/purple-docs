### Additional Observations

**Machine-Readable Price Transparency Files Review**

* **MRFs Up-to-Date:** ✔️ Yes, the MRFs are kept up to date each month.
* **Table of Contents Accessibility:**  ❌ The Table of Contents link is easily accessible but not updated at the beginning of each month.
* **Table of Contents Formatting:** ✔️ Yes, the Table of Contents is properly formatted.
* **File Download Barriers:** ✔️ No barriers to downloading the MRFs.
* **File Accessibility Percentage:** ✔️ 100% of the files are accessible.

**Overall Assessment:** BCBS Tennessee does not post until the end of each month, but does keep up with posting their data. There is a link in their table of contents that is invalid ([https://d7k0rj9u1dp84.cloudfront.net/TCR\_Output\_JSON/C\_$folder$](https://d7k0rj9u1dp84.cloudfront.net/TCR_Output_JSON/C_$folder$)) but this appears to be a result of a system error and we don't feel it's valid. They duplicate provider data substantially, but that can be a result of interpretation of the CMS rules.

### Customer Anecdotes

A customer has noted that for some codes, BCBS Tennessee includes many hundreds of rates for the same providers/modifiers. This is likely a mistake, as much of the data is clean, but it is important to note that this does cause BCBS Tennessee to be out of compliance.
